      <h2>1. Definition</h2>

      <p>
        NeuroSaaS™ (Neuroscience-as-a-Service) is an architecture for the development and orchestration of digital systems based on principles of neuroscience, cognitive plasticity, and metacognition — not as metaphors, but as structural foundations.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than adaptive software, NeuroSaaS™ is a systemic cognitive infrastructure: a model for designing technological ecosystems capable of evolving in synchrony with the mental, emotional, and cultural transformation of their users.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is about creating systems that do not merely respond to behavior,
        but coexist with human internal evolution, accompanying, reflecting, and amplifying real cycles of change.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not a technique.<br />
        It is an operational ontology.
      </p>

      <div class="rule"></div>
    </section>

    <section id="proposito">
      <h2>2. Purpose</h2>

      <p>
        A large portion of digital systems is developed based on fixed usage patterns, assuming stability in human behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        The purpose of NeuroSaaS™ is to establish a model in which this assumption does not hold.
        Human beings are understood as a continuous process of transformation — and systems must be designed to accompany this dynamic in a coherent, ethical, and adaptable way.
      </p>

      <div class="rule"></div>
    </section>

    <section id="posicao">
      <h2>3. Conceptual Position</h2>

      <p>
        NeuroSaaS™ is not a technique, nor a framework of artificial intelligence.
        It is an ontological infrastructure for the development of digital systems with continuous adaptive reorganization capability.
      </p>

      <p>
        It may use AI, machine learning, or any other computational technology — but these are auxiliary tools, not the core of the proposal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The central element is not the technology employed, but the system’s ability to maintain evolutionary coherence with human cognitive transformation over time.
      </p>

      <div class="rule"></div>
    </section>

    <section id="principios">
      <h2>4. Fundamental Principles</h2>

      <p><strong>4.1 Plasticity as a structural basis</strong></p>
      <p>
        Systems must be conceived to reorganize their structures over time, inspired by the principle of neuroplasticity.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4.2 Cognitive-centered design</strong></p>
      <p>
        User experience is evaluated based on cognitive load, attention, working memory, focus, and mental availability.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4.3 Bidirectional adaptation</strong></p>
      <p>
        The system adapts to the user and simultaneously influences the usage trajectory in a controlled and ethical manner.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4.4 Mental sustainability</strong></p>
      <p>
        Informational overload, excessive stimulation, and dependency patterns must be avoided. Priority is given to cognitive stability.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4.5 Continuous evolution</strong></p>
      <p>
        NeuroSaaS™ systems are not static. Their development occurs in cycles aligned with human transformations.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4.6 Metacognitive foundation</strong></p>
      <p>
        The NeuroSaaS™ architecture is metacognitive by nature. Each system instance is designed to observe its own cognitive impact, assess utility, and reorganize its logic accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not about predicting behavior, but about reflecting and restructuring based on the real impact of human interaction.
      </p>

        <li>Not a redefinition of artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>Not a disguised data collection mechanism</li>
        <li>Not a software category</li>

      <h2>7. Systemic Scalability</h2>

      <p>
        NeuroSaaS™ is a replicable architectural language, capable of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>sustaining multiple products and platforms</li>
        <li>operating in distributed networks</li>
        <li>structuring organizations and ecosystems</li>
        <li>maintaining conceptual coherence over time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Its scalability lies in structural logic, not in code or user volume.

    </section>

    <section id="evolucao">
      <h2>8. Architected Evolution</h2>

      <p>
        Any modification to a NeuroSaaS™ system must simultaneously meet the following criteria:
      </p>

      <ol style="max-width: 84ch; padding-left: 18px; color: rgba(233,233,233,0.90); font-size: var(--p);">
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px;">Improvement of user cognitive reading</li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px;">Preservation of plasticity and adaptability</li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px;">Alignment with human cycles of transformation</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Changes that do not meet all three criteria do not constitute valid evolution.
      </p>

      <div class="rule"></div>
    </section>

    <section id="neutralidade">
      <h2>9. Application Neutrality</h2>

      <p>
        NeuroSaaS™ is not tied to a specific sector, product, or domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        It may be applied in educational, corporate, social, institutional, or cultural contexts,
        provided its structural principles are preserved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Application is free.<br />
        Definition is canonical.
      </p>

      <div class="rule"></div>
    </section>

    <section id="poc">
      <h2>10. Conceptual Proof in Development</h2>

      <p>
        NeuroSaaS™ structures are already being tested in controlled contexts and experimental environments, focused on applying their principles in real-world scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>These tests involve:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Applications with continuous cognitive reorganization</li>
        <li>Interfaces with metacognitive logic</li>
        <li>Systemic adaptation based on human cycles of transformation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The nature of these applications is strategic and protected,
        but insights are feeding conceptual and technical iterations that strengthen the NeuroSaaS™ architecture as a replicable foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than a vision of the future, this is a structure in real activation, guided by processes of practical validation and continuous adjustment.

    <section id="finais">
      <h2>11. Final Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        NeuroSaaS™ proposes a system development model aligned with the evolutionary nature of human beings.
      </p>

      <p>
        It does not seek to replicate cognition, nor to automate adaptation.
        It proposes a new paradigm: systems that share the evolutionary process with their users.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is technology that does not replicate intelligence — but evolves with it.
