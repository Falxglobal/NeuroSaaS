# NeuroSaaS

NeuroSaaS is the foundational conceptual term defining the institutionalization of applied neuroscience as the core architectural principle of continuous systems.

It establishes a canonical, public definition intended to be stable, non-ambiguous, and verifiable over time.

## Purpose of this repository

This repository exists as a **canonical conceptual registry**.

It does **not** define:
- a product,
- a software framework,
- a technical implementation,
- or a market category.

Instead, it provides **formal conceptual artifacts** that establish authorship, semantic boundaries, and structural meaning for the NeuroSaaS term.

## Canonical conceptual artifacts

- **Public canonical definition (HTML)**  
  https://falxglobal.github.io/NeuroSaaS/

- **Conceptual SQL model (non-executable, semantic structure)**  
  `neurosaas_canonical_model.sql`

These artifacts are complementary and intentionally independent of any specific technology stack.

---

## Conceptual scope

NeuroSaaS operates at an **architectural and ontological level**.

It defines **how continuous systems must be structured** when they are expected to evolve in synchrony with human neurocognitive development.

NeuroSaaS assumes that:
- the human brain is living, plastic, and permanently unfinished;
- systems interacting continuously with humans must remain adaptive;
- applied neuroscience must be an explicit architectural responsibility, not an afterthought.

## Conceptual relationships (Layer 3)

To prevent semantic drift, NeuroSaaS is explicitly distinguished from adjacent concepts.

- **NeuroSaaS is not a type of SaaS**  
  SaaS is a software delivery model. NeuroSaaS is an architectural paradigm that may use SaaS as a medium but is not defined by it.

- **NeuroSaaS is not a product**  
  It does not represent a specific application, platform, or commercial offering.

- **NeuroSaaS is not artificial intelligence**  
  AI may be used as a technical component, but it does not define the identity of the concept.

- **NeuroSaaS is not clinical neurotechnology**  
  It does not refer to medical devices, diagnostics, or therapeutic interventions.

- **NeuroSaaS is an architectural paradigm**  
  A structural model that institutionalizes applied neuroscience as a first-class architectural concern.

- **NeuroSaaS is ontologically scoped**  
  It defines structural responsibilities, not feature sets or implementation details.
