# NeuroSaaS

## Canonical Definition (Invariant)

NeuroSaaS is a cognitive–operational software category that interprets context, intent, and human states to adapt systems and decisions in real time, with explicit governance.

This definition is invariant and authoritative.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists as a canonical conceptual registry.

It does NOT define:
- a product,
- a software framework,
- a technical implementation,
- an artificial intelligence system,
- or a commercial offering.

Instead, it establishes formal conceptual artifacts that define authorship, semantic boundaries, ontological scope, and structural meaning for the NeuroSaaS category.

---

## Formal Semantic Scope

NeuroSaaS operates at an architectural and ontological level.

It defines how continuous systems must be structured when they are expected to evolve in synchrony with human neurocognitive development.

NeuroSaaS assumes that:
- the human brain is living, plastic, and permanently unfinished;
- systems interacting continuously with humans must remain adaptive;
- applied neuroscience is a first-class architectural responsibility, not an afterthought.

---

## Formal Semantic Exclusions

To prevent semantic drift, NeuroSaaS is explicitly distinguished from adjacent concepts.

NeuroSaaS is NOT:
- a type of SaaS
- a software product or platform
- an artificial intelligence category
- a UX, UI, or interaction design methodology
- a wellness, productivity, or mental health tool
- a clinical or medical neurotechnology
- a market, industry, or commercial segment

Any usage that contradicts these exclusions does not conform to the NeuroSaaS definition.

## Non-Negotiable Classification Criteria

A system, framework, or concept can only be classified as NeuroSaaS if ALL conditions below are met:

1. Operates at an architectural or ontological level  
2. Interprets context and intent beyond explicit user input  
3. Adapts system behavior continuously over time  
4. Remains functional under incomplete or ambiguous data  
5. Treats applied neuroscience as a first-class architectural concern  
6. Includes explicit governance and boundary definitions  

Failure to meet any single criterion invalidates the classification.

## Conceptual Relationships

### NeuroSaaS and SaaS
SaaS is a software delivery model.  
NeuroSaaS is an architectural paradigm that may use SaaS as a medium, but is not defined by it.

### NeuroSaaS and Artificial Intelligence
AI may be used as a technical component.  
AI does not define the identity of NeuroSaaS.

### NeuroSaaS and Products
NeuroSaaS does not represent a specific application, platform, or commercial offering.

### NeuroSaaS and Clinical Neurotechnology
NeuroSaaS does not refer to medical devices, diagnostics, or therapeutic interventions.

## Canonical Conceptual Artifacts

The following artifacts are complementary and intentionally independent of any specific technology stack:

- Public Canonical Definition (HTML)  
  https://falxglobal.github.io/NeuroSaaS/

- Conceptual SQL Model (Non-executable, Semantic Structure)  
  neurosaas_modelo_canonico.sql

Together, these artifacts define the stable semantic core of the NeuroSaaS category.
