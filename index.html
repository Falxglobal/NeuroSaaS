<h1>NeuroSaaS — Original Concept Term</h1>

<h3>Authorship and Public Record — FalX — 2026</h3>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>
NeuroSaaS is the institutionalization of applied neuroscience
as the core architecture of continuous products and systems,
designed to evolve in synchrony with human neurocognitive development,
both individual and collective.
</p>

<p>
It is based on the structural principle that the human brain
is a living, plastic and permanently unfinished system,
and therefore any product that continuously interacts with people
must evolve at the same pace or become cognitively limiting.
</p>

<h2>Ontological nature</h2>

<p>
NeuroSaaS is not a type of software, business model or market category.
It is a neuroevolutionary function translated into product form.
</p>

<h2>Authorship and origin</h2>

<p>
The term NeuroSaaS was originally conceived and defined by FalX
as a foundational concept describing systems and products
whose core architecture is explicitly oriented
toward continuous human neurocognitive development.
