    <h1>NeuroSaaS — Original Concept Term</h1>

    <h2>Authorship and Public Record — FalX — 2026</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        NeuroSaaS is the institutionalization of applied neuroscience
        as the core architecture of continuous products and systems.
        It is designed to evolve in synchrony with human neurocognitive
        development, both at the individual and collective levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is based on the structural principle that the human brain
        is a living, plastic, and permanently unfinished system.
        Therefore, any product or system that continuously interacts
        with people must evolve at a compatible pace, or it becomes
        cognitively limiting.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Ontological Nature</h3>
      <p>
        NeuroSaaS is not a type of software, a business model,
        or a market category.
      </p>

      <p>
        It represents a neuroevolutionary function translated
        into product and system architecture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Authorship and Origin</h3>
      <p>
        The term and concept <strong>NeuroSaaS</strong> were originally
        created by FalX as an intellectual framework to correct a
        structural asymmetry in the digital era, where technological
        systems evolved faster than human neurocognitive adaptation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This concept is publicly documented here to establish
        authorship, origin, and temporal precedence.

    <section>
      <h3>Canonical Closure</h3>
      <p>
        NeuroSaaS represents a structural correction in the digital era,
        where human neurocognitive development ceases to be a collateral
        effect of technological progress and becomes an explicit
        responsibility of product and system architecture.
